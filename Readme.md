Our Idea
---

sdu.store is an e-commerce platform based on the real shop located at Suleyman Demirel University (SDU). The online store has been developed using the Go programming language as part of a project. The platform offers a unique shopping experience for students and alumni of SDU.

The online store offers a wide range of products that are also available in the physical shop, including university-branded merchandise, study essentials, fashion and lifestyle products, and much more. Customers can easily navigate the website and make purchases with a few clicks.

In addition to the convenience of online shopping, sdu.store also offers special discounts and promotions for students and alumni of SDU. This makes the store a great place for them to find affordable products while showing their university pride.

With the goal of providing a seamless shopping experience, sdu.store aims to become a popular destination for students and alumni of SDU to purchase products both online and in-store. By leveraging the technology and programming skills developed in this project, the store hopes to provide a convenient and affordable shopping experience for the university community.

What we use
---
Golang framework net/http for server side

sdu.store has been developed using Go programming language and leverages several popular libraries and tools. The platform is built using the Go standard library's net/http package for handling HTTP requests and responses.

For database management, the platform uses gorm, a high-level ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library for Go. This allows for easy interaction with the database and simplifies the process of storing and retrieving data from the database. The platform uses PostgreSQL as its database management system, which is a powerful and open-source relational database management system.

By utilizing these tools, sdu.store provides a fast, reliable, and scalable platform for online shopping. The use of Go, gorm, and PostgreSQL allows the platform to efficiently manage and process large amounts of data, ensuring a seamless shopping experience for customers.
