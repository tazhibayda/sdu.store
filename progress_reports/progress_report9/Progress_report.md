# Progress Report 9

During the past week, our team has been working on developing new functionalities for our e-commerce platform. Specifically, we focused on four main tasks: product item function, retrieving products of a certain category, product filter function with a rating filter, and rating add function. Below is a detailed overview of our progress and achievements in each area.

## What we did?
- Items function
- Category Products function and page
- Product filter function
- Rating add function

### Product Item Function:
We developed a product item function that allows users to view detailed information about a specific product. This function retrieves data from our database and displays it on a separate page. Users can see the product image, name, description, price, and other relevant information.

### Retrieving Products of a Certain Category:
We also added a new feature that enables users to search for products by category. Users can select a category from a drop-down menu, and our system retrieves all products that belong to that category from the database.

### Product Filter Function without a Rating Filter:

This feature was especially useful for users who had specific preferences when shopping for products.

### Rating add function:

This feature allowed users to rate products they had purchased or used. Users could rate products on a scale of 1 to 5 and leave comments about their experience. This feature helped other users make informed decisions when purchasing products and also provided valuable feedback to the product sellers.
